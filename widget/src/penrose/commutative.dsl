-- We need very specific, conjunctive predicates as opposed to e.g. `IsFacingRight`
-- or `IsHorizontal` mostly in order to optimize constraint solving by having fewer
-- objectives, and also to make positioning work reliably.
-- TODO: these might break when the target is a cell; can't force cell positioning, probably?
